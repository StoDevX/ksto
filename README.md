##KSTO Radio

__KSTO Radio__ is a student-run radio station of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. The station broadcasts over the airwaves on campus at 93.1 FM. With [this app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ksto/id953916647), you can listen to shows, call-in to the station, see who will broadcast next, and learn the history of our station.

KSTO offers the same opportunity to any St. Olaf student since 1957, asking only that on-air personalities adhere to the same FCC guidelines which govern every radio station in the country. Beyond that, there is no censorship or policies dictating what types of music students can play and what topics of conversation they can cover.

KSTO broadcasts from a dedicated space on the lower level of Buntrock Commons, St. Olafâ€™s campus center. This production suite consists of a reception room, office for managers and music directors, on air studio, and recording studio.

### Todo
* Show notifications from DJs (started using Parse before it died)
* In-app chat that would allow listeners to talk with each other and the current streaming DJ in the studio. Would need to work as Wordpress plugin to be on the KSTO Pages website
* Show-off current staff for each year in a section of the app (have it be dynamic in the form of JSON pulled-in and rendered)
